class FindRightIntervals{
    /**
     * Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point
     * is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.

        For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval j
        has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist,
        store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.

        Note:

        You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
        You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.
 
        Example 2:

        Input: [ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]

        Output: [-1, 0, 1]

        Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
        For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
        For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.

        Idea: If we have a sorted list of starting points, then we just have to use
        binary search to find the ceil for the endpoint. This would give us the closest
        starting point that is greater than or equal to endpoint. But we need index of the 
        interval, so we store the starting point-index in a treeMap and use its ceilingEntry method
        to get both starting point and the index.

        ceilingEntry basically does bsearch inside, as entries are stored in a balanced binary search tree.

            int endPoint = intervals[i][1];
            Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> rightInterval = startPoints.ceilingEntry(endPoint);
            // store the index of the matching interval
            rightIntervals[i] = rightInterval == null ? -1 : rightInterval.getValue();
